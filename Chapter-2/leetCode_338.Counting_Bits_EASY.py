# 338. Counting Bits
"""
Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is 
the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 105
 

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) 
and possibly in a single pass?
Can you do it without using any built-in function?

WHAT IS BINARY REPRESENTATION and DECIMAL AND HOW TO CONVERT IT

What is Decimal to Binary Formula?
In the formula to convert decimal to the binary method, we will perform division on the given decimal number 
recursively by 2 and note down the remainders till we have either 0 or 1 as the final quotient. Steps that are 
used to convert decimal to the binary number using decimal to the binary formula are shown below,

Step 1: Divide the given decimal number by 2, note down the remainder.
Step 2: Now divide the quotient thus obtained in the above step by 2, note down the remainder.
Step 3: Repeat the above steps until we get 0 or 1 as a quotient.
Step 4: Write down the last quotient in line with remainders from last to the first, this is our binary conversion 
of the given decimal number.

Example 1: Using decimal to binary formula, convert 29 decimal into a binary number.

Solution:

Using decimal to binary formula, we have,
Step 1: Divide the number by 2, note down the remainder:
29 รท 2 gives Q1 = 14, R = 1

Step 2: Divide Q1 by 2, note down the remainder:
14 รท 2 gives Q2 = 7, R = 0

Step 3: Divide Q2 by 2, note down the remainder:
7 รท 2 gives Q3 = 3, R = 1

Step 4: Divide Q3 by 2, note down the remainder:
3 รท 2 gives Q4 = 1, R = 1

Step 5: Write down the last quotient in line with remainders from last to the first, this is our binary conversion of the given decimal number:
11101

Answer: Hence, 29 as binary is 
11101 with lower 2 (opposite to ^) - probably binary representation.
